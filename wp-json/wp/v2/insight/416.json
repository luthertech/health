When you\u2019re in the business of building apps and have neither a technical nor a design background, you might be surprised how often you\u2019ll hear this word thrown around. You may be making the mistake of thinking that design is all about how your product looks, how the sections are set on the screen, how big a button is, or what colours the app is using.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"353a\" class=\"xi xj rh bf xk xl xm xn ky xo xp xq lc wv xr xs xt wz xu xv xw xd xx xy xz ya bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In truth, <strong class=\"am\">design has stopped being only about looks<\/strong> a while ago.<\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"yb yc yd\">\n<p id=\"d689\" class=\"wk wl ye wm b wn wo wp wq wr ws wt wu wv ww wx wy wz xa xb xc xd xe xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><em class=\"rh\">\u201cMost people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like.

John Maeda, Sillicon Valley executive, designer and technologist, has been<a class=\"ag oc\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2015\/03\/take-expert-design-important-ever\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\"> making the case for the business value of design<\/a> since 2015. Through his work, he has been connecting the worlds of design, technology and business together, so that people wouldn\u2019t see them as three different things. <a class=\"ag oc\" href=\"https:\/\/designintech.report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">He argues<\/a> that 63 design firms were acquired by big tech names like Google, Facebook, Accenture or IBM.<\/p>\n<p id=\"fcdb\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph wk wl rh wm b wn wo wp wq wr ws wt wu wv ww wx wy wz xa xb xc xd xe xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Moreso, companies with strong design philosophies, including Apple, Coca-Cola, IBM, Nike, Procter &amp; Gamble and Whirlpool have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past 10 years by an extraordinary 219%, as reported by the <a class=\"ag oc\" href=\"http:\/\/www.dmi.org\/?page=designdrivesvalue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Design Management Institute<\/a> in a 2014 assessment.<\/p>\n<p id=\"33e6\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph wk wl rh wm b wn wo wp wq wr ws wt wu wv ww wx wy wz xa xb xc xd xe xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">So we can confidently say that applying design methodologies to your app development process will give you a boost in becoming a success. <strong class=\"wm ku\">But what are you supposed to do, with no design background?<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"9b81\" class=\"yf xj rh bf xk kv yg kw ky kz yh la lc ie yi if ii lf yj lg lj lk yk ll lo yl bk\">You don\u2019t have to be a designer to think like one<\/h2>\n<p id=\"55a6\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph wk wl rh wm b wn ym wp wq wr yn wt wu wv yo wx wy wz yp xb xc xd yq xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Before any designer puts one line on the paper (or the screen), they spend significant time thinking about how to approach the project they have in front of them. Rather than talk about what\u2019s committed to paper for a product\u2019s design, let\u2019s talk about the design thinking going on.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"yr\">\n<p id=\"d277\" class=\"ys yt rh bf yu yv yw yx yy yz za xh dt\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"am\"><em class=\"zb\">What is design thinking?<\/em><\/strong> Well, in simple words, it\u2019s the way you approach a problem to solve it.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"5249\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph wk wl rh wm b wn zc wp wq wr zd wt wu wv ze wx wy wz zf xb xc xd zg xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It\u2019s especially useful when the problem in front of you is complex or unknown, as it makes you understand the human needs involved.

While his model consists of seven major stages, the more current interpretation \u2014 the five-stage model proposed by the Hasso-Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford, the leading university in teaching Design Thinking \u2014 is a lot more well known and more widely applied.<\/p>\n<p id=\"328c\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph wk wl rh wm b wn wo wp wq wr ws wt wu wv ww wx wy wz xa xb xc xd xe xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Next, we\u2019ll walk you through the five stages, so you too can learn how to apply design thinking in developing your own product.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"3961\" class=\"xi xj rh bf xk xl xm xn ky xo xp xq lc wv xr xs xt wz xu xv xw xd xx xy xz ya bk\">Step 1. Empathise<\/h3>\n<p id=\"0925\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph wk wl rh wm b wn ym wp wq wr yn wt wu wv yo wx wy wz yp xb xc xd yq xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The first stage of approaching a problem with a design thinking mindset is to immerse yourself in the problem. Talk to experts to understand their view on your area of concern. Engage and shadow the people who are most affected by the problem and see how they\u2019re handling it now. This is a good moment to conduct more or less formal interviews to get a clear understanding of who your potential users are, what characterises them, what their frustrations and goals are.<\/p>\n<p id=\"d266\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph wk wl rh wm b wn wo wp wq wr ws wt wu wv ww wx wy wz xa xb xc xd xe xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Depending on how much time and resources you have, this stage can turn into a research marathon or just a dipping on toes into the data pool. Either way, <strong class=\"wm ku\">make sure you expose yourself to different approaches and perspectives<\/strong>, to gain a fuller experience.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"83a0\" class=\"xi xj rh bf xk xl xm xn ky xo xp xq lc wv xr xs xt wz xu xv xw xd xx xy xz ya bk\">Step 2. Define<\/h3>\n<p id=\"11bf\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph wk wl rh wm b wn ym wp wq wr yn wt wu wv yo wx wy wz yp xb xc xd yq xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">At this point, your job is to analyse and synthetise the information you\u2019ve gathered in the previous stage. Define core problems that you have seen repeating and how it manifests in different types of audiences. Some may be more affected by the problem you\u2019re tackling than others. Especially when you\u2019re working to define your MVP, <strong class=\"wm ku\">prioritising problems<\/strong> that have greater reverberations in a larger audience will give your product more chances of success once you launch it.<\/p>\n<p id=\"7edb\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph wk wl rh wm b wn wo wp wq wr ws wt wu wv ww wx wy wz xa xb xc xd xe xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Don\u2019t be surprised when the problems you identify is moving you towards asking questions that lead you to solutions. That is, after all, the whole purpose of this exercise. Do make sure that you\u2019ve gotten all the insights out of your research that you can, before moving forward to the next stage.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"00a8\" class=\"xi xj rh bf xk xl xm xn ky xo xp xq lc wv xr xs xt wz xu xv xw xd xx xy xz ya bk\">Step 3. Ideate<\/h3>\n<p id=\"ec9c\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph wk wl rh wm b wn ym wp wq wr yn wt wu wv yo wx wy wz yp xb xc xd yq xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">With all perspectives of the problem in front of you and the valuable insights you\u2019ve gained, you\u2019re ready to think about solutions. It\u2019s important to get as many ideas as possible on the table at the beginning of this session. Don\u2019t worry about budget, or implementation time, or human resources. <strong class=\"wm ku\">The more approaches you can think of, and the more possible features you can put on the list for your product, the easier it will be to narrow them down.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p id=\"99b7\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph wk wl rh wm b wn wo wp wq wr ws wt wu wv ww wx wy wz xa xb xc xd xe xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">At the end of this stage, you may want to take a few ideas and run them by people who have helped you in the first stage. At this point, getting verbal feedback is valuable in helping you narrow down to the best solution available. From the feedback you get, decide on a handful of ideas that you want to take to the next stage.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"d9d5\" class=\"xi xj rh bf xk xl xm xn ky xo xp xq lc wv xr xs xt wz xu xv xw xd xx xy xz ya bk\">Step 4. Prototype<\/h3>\n<p id=\"4645\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph wk wl rh wm b wn ym wp wq wr yn wt wu wv yo wx wy wz yp xb xc xd yq xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">When you hear prototype, you may think of complex, real-looking app prototypes. But the truth of the matter is that an inexpensive \u2014 let me ask my friend with better drawing skills than I have to put some boxes on a bunch of papers \u2014 prototype is more than enough for this experimental phase. Your purpose is to show your idea around your colleagues, a group of friends, the dedicated mentor and getting validation for your solutions. If one of your acquaintances happens to be the living embodiment of the audience you\u2019re targeting, make sure you reach out to them as well.<\/p>\n<p id=\"4b20\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph wk wl rh wm b wn wo wp wq wr ws wt wu wv ww wx wy wz xa xb xc xd xe xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">You\u2019ll notice at this point that the feedback you receive will be very useful in better understanding how users would behave, think and feel when interacting with the end product. <strong class=\"wm ku\">At the end of this stage, you\u2019ll feel more confident to invest more resources in the solution that gets the most positive feedback.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"01eb\" class=\"xi xj rh bf xk xl xm xn ky xo xp xq lc wv xr xs xt wz xu xv xw xd xx xy xz ya bk\">Step 5. Test<\/h3>\n<p id=\"28e8\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph wk wl rh wm b wn ym wp wq wr yn wt wu wv yo wx wy wz yp xb xc xd yq xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">At this stage, you\u2019re ready to put forward a product, whether it\u2019s a high-definition prototype or a beta version of your app. Your purpose here is to make a realistic rendering of your product and go wider with its promotion than your current social circles: join a startup-themed meetup, present at a pitch night, get in front of retail investors. <strong class=\"wm ku\">Get real feedback from real people<\/strong>, that have no reason to sugarcoat their thinking.<\/p>\n<p id=\"815e\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph wk wl rh wm b wn wo wp wq wr ws wt wu wv ww wx wy wz xa xb xc xd xe xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">While testing is the last stage in the design thinking framework, the process should be considered an iterative endeavour: the results you get from testing may be used to redefine the scope of your product and to get more information on how users feel and behave when they\u2019re using your product. From there, you can move onto a new cycle of design thinking, with the stated purpose of building a better version of your product.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"b9ce\" class=\"yf xj rh bf xk kv yg kw ky kz yh la lc ie yi if ii lf yj lg lj lk yk ll lo yl bk\">Design thinking makes your product the best version of itself<\/h2>\n<p id=\"c7d1\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph wk wl rh wm b wn ym wp wq wr yn wt wu wv yo wx wy wz yp xb xc xd yq xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">At the end of the day, the design thinking process is iterative, flexible and with the focus set on the collaboration between product owners (or designers) and users. Its framework helps you come up with ideas that are based on how users think, feel and behave. Most importantly, if you keep the wheel of design thinking turning, your product will get better with every iteration and get closer to success by directly responding to the needs of your users.<\/p>\n<p id=\"ca6b\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph wk wl rh wm b wn wo wp wq wr ws wt wu wv ww wx wy wz xa xb xc xd xe xf xg xh ew bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In an industry where making the wrong assumptions can cost you the success of your product, a design thinking approach can keep you grounded in realistic information about your users.
