After all, the stereotype of the lone genius creating value while hiding themselves away is persistent in every budding entrepreneur\u2019s mind.<\/p>\n<p id=\"b7e3\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lz ma fr mb b mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">But the fact of the matter is that there is more value to be found in collaboration and improvement. Today\u2019s innovation in the startup scene is based less on never-thought-of inventions and more on improving existing industries, whether through better service, better technology or more efficient distribution channels. That is why it is a better move for your future business to just start talking about it with everyone and anyone who could be interested.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"f97a\" class=\"mx my fr bf mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu bk\">Why it\u2019s good for you to share your idea<\/h2>\n<p id=\"1faa\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lz ma fr mb b mc nv me mf mg nw mi mj mk nx mm mn mo ny mq mr ms nz mu mv mw fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Sharing your idea allows you to:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li id=\"5c68\" class=\"lz ma fr mb b mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw oa ob oc bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"mb fs\">Get feedback.<\/strong> Talk about your idea with industry insiders, people who have an overlap with your business, future users. Basically, anyone with an interest who isn\u2019t a direct competitor. They will give you the feedback you need to build a clear image of the industry you\u2019re approaching, as well as what features will make or break your app.<\/li>\n<li id=\"4a49\" class=\"lz ma fr mb b mc od me mf mg oe mi mj mk of mm mn mo og mq mr ms oh mu mv mw oa ob oc bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"mb fs\">Promote yourself and your business idea.<\/strong> As you share your idea, your passion will become infectious and spread on to other people as well. You will become the go-to person for your little slice of the industry. And remember that people who are excited about your idea are most likely to be your first users and the ones who will most likely spread word of mouth.<\/li>\n<li id=\"1473\" class=\"lz ma fr mb b mc od me mf mg oe mi mj mk of mm mn mo og mq mr ms oh mu mv mw oa ob oc bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"mb fs\">Practice pitching your idea.<\/strong> Nothing makes you better at selling your idea like talking about it, again and again.
