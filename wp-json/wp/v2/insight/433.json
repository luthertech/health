With over 5 million apps (and counting) available on App Store and Google Play, it\u2019s necessary to ensure your product has a distinct marketplace. What you need is to find a specific niche in that marketplace, where despite existing dominant players, you have the capacity to solve a problem or address a want that no else is.<\/p>\n<p id=\"3fd0\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Once you work out whether your idea is worth building, you can pursue it wholeheartedly.

Once you understand who your target audience would be, conduct surveys, research and interviews with these people. Set out to do at least 40 one-on-one user interviews, preferably live or through an online call. You\u2019re bound to get the most valuable information through moderated interaction, while any additional data you gather through focus groups or online surveys will give you added value.<\/p>\n<p id=\"51c4\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The purpose of your market research is to understand what your potential users\u2019 pressing needs and wants are, what extra features would be necessary, what advantages your competitors offer, or where your target base operates. Knowing all this will assist in developing a rewarding user experience, which, in turn, will drive the success of your app. Optimising features to make your users happy will give it a clear advantage over competitors. By doing meaningful analysis, your work will allow you to present potential partners and investors with tangible evidence of user and market interest.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"19f0\" class=\"mx my fr bf mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh lw ni nj nk ma nl nm nn me no np nq nr bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"am\">Assess Your Competition<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p id=\"35e6\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo ns lq lr ls nt lu lv lw nu ly lz ma nv mc md me nw mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Assessing your existing competition is paramount before deciding whether your idea is worthy of your efforts and finances. Your task at this stage is to ascertain who else is doing what you\u2019re attempting to achieve, and who else is doing something similar, but not quite the same.<\/p>\n<p id=\"9633\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"ln fs\">Don\u2019t be deterred by the existence of a successful competing product<\/strong>; if your business strategy has an essential point of difference, like solving a problem posed by them, or targeting a different audience, it is valid. Do be wary if you find nobody else is doing what you\u2019re attempting to do. Answering the question \u2018why does this not exist yet?\u2019 is vital before further developing your business idea \u2014 you might find that the market is still too small or is dwindling, or that there is a key piece of technology or legal context missing. Any of these factors will be a critical roadblock in making your business idea a reality.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"mm mn mo mp mq mr mj mk paragraph-image\">\n<div class=\"ms mt ee mu bh mv\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">\n<div class=\"mj mk nx\"><picture><source srcset=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:640\/format:webp\/1*glg-NOLxnL65lZv9wZwa2Q.jpeg 640w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:720\/format:webp\/1*glg-NOLxnL65lZv9wZwa2Q.jpeg 720w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:750\/format:webp\/1*glg-NOLxnL65lZv9wZwa2Q.jpeg 750w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:786\/format:webp\/1*glg-NOLxnL65lZv9wZwa2Q.jpeg 786w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:828\/format:webp\/1*glg-NOLxnL65lZv9wZwa2Q.jpeg 828w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:1100\/format:webp\/1*glg-NOLxnL65lZv9wZwa2Q.jpeg 1100w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:1400\/format:webp\/1*glg-NOLxnL65lZv9wZwa2Q.jpeg 1400w\" type=\"image\/webp\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><source srcset=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:640\/1*glg-NOLxnL65lZv9wZwa2Q.jpeg 640w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:720\/1*glg-NOLxnL65lZv9wZwa2Q.jpeg 720w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:750\/1*glg-NOLxnL65lZv9wZwa2Q.jpeg 750w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:786\/1*glg-NOLxnL65lZv9wZwa2Q.jpeg 786w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:828\/1*glg-NOLxnL65lZv9wZwa2Q.jpeg 828w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:1100\/1*glg-NOLxnL65lZv9wZwa2Q.jpeg 1100w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:1400\/1*glg-NOLxnL65lZv9wZwa2Q.jpeg 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-testid=\"og\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"bh kt mw c\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:700\/1*glg-NOLxnL65lZv9wZwa2Q.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"445\" \/><\/picture><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<h2 id=\"f808\" class=\"mx my fr bf mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh lw ni nj nk ma nl nm nn me no np nq nr bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Seek Feedback<\/h2>\n<p id=\"90d6\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo ns lq lr ls nt lu lv lw nu ly lz ma nv mc md me nw mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Pitching to investors is the final step to idea validation \u2014 not the first. Before starting the long process of app development, check off your list all the research questions about your industry and competition. Next, ensure you discuss your concept both with industry insiders and professionals. Casting out your idea to a close circle of people with valuable insights, and circling out from there will ensure you\u2019re not operating inside a vacuum. Try to talk to about 10 people, aiming for different perspectives. You can stop the interviews sooner if the answers get repetitive, or choose to go further if you feel you still have unanswered questions.<\/p>\n<p id=\"43d2\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Nevertheless, don\u2019t necessarily incorporate every opinion you receive. Business insiders and professionals tend to be on the fence when it comes to feedback, and even their advice will be coloured by their previous experiences. Indeed, it makes a world of a difference having people to pound with questions, who help you understand the components that don\u2019t work in your business model. But it\u2019s essential to be rational in evaluating their feedback and find on your own a system in which every component fits together to make for a successful business.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"8ef5\" class=\"mx my fr bf mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh lw ni nj nk ma nl nm nn me no np nq nr bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Do It All In One Go<\/h2>\n<p id=\"ade7\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo ns lq lr ls nt lu lv lw nu ly lz ma nv mc md me nw mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Normally, we\u2019re not the ones to toot our own horns, but if the glove fits, your have to do it, don\u2019t you? <strong class=\"ln fs\">After helping over 200 founders validate their ideas, we\u2019ve come up with an <\/strong><strong class=\"ln fs\">essential startup package<\/strong><strong class=\"ln fs\"> that\u2019s focused on telling you whether you\u2019ve got the next big thing or not.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p id=\"fb05\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">We\u2019ll guide you through all of the above and help you validate your idea with a world-class prototype that looks and feels like a real app. Explore your idea with industry insiders, understand your market, test your assumptions with real users, get relevant feedback and turn your app idea into a viable business model.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Successful tech companies aren\u2019t built on motivation alone, but by testing the viability of the idea behind the business.
