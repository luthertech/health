We can agree that the gold rush is over. We won\u2019t see another Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat or other massive tech company in this industry. It\u2019s not even worth trying to replicate their success in the same way they achieved it, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the industry is dying. It simply means things are changing, and while everyone talks about self driving cars, AI, Virtual and Augmented reality, there\u2019s a silent revolution happening elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p id=\"401f\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The next wave of game-changing entrepreneurs are likely to be from a non-technical background.

And if there\u2019s one lesson worth remembering from the success of big players, it\u2019s that they didn\u2019t start out big. Features that cater to every need and surprising interaction tidbits that make an app enjoyable are all useful to consider, but not when you are starting your entrepreneurship journey. In fact, the way they started out, the way you should start out as well, is by defining your Minimum Viable Product and putting it out there to be tested.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"9e6d\" class=\"mj mk fr bf ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng bk\">What is an MVP?<\/h2>\n<p id=\"729a\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo nh lq lr ls ni lu lv lw nj ly lz ma nk mc md me nl mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The term Minimum Viable Product was first coined by Frank Robinson and was popularised by the LEAN startup figureheads Eric Ries and Steve Blank.

But you would start by building a skateboard (if you\u2019re terribly short on resources, you could build it with three wheels!). You\u2019d test it to see if people were interested and willing to use it, and get feedback like: \u2018oh, this is nice\u2019, and \u2019I\u2019m moving much faster\u2019 and \u2018I wish I didn\u2019t have to stand all the time\u2019. Your skateboard checks both the minimum requirement (a board and three wheels are straightforward to put together), and the viable requirement (people are using it and giving you feedback, so you have reasons to make more and improve them). Moreso, because in our hypothetical scenario, you are the only provider building and selling skateboards, your users are willing to forgive the learning curve and the occasional accident because you\u2019re solving a very pressing need.<\/p>\n<p id=\"2f7d\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Your next step would be to make a bicycle: more comfortable and safe to use, requiring less effort.

As you set out to define your MVP, keep your value proposition at the top of your mind \u2014 it should guide all of your future decisions.<\/p>\n<p id=\"3e13\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For example, you know your ice cream finder app is targeted towards a young, urban audience, with a passion for desserts. You also know that your competition is very diversified with their recommendations, and complex in the information they offer. So the value proposition for your product could be:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"nx ny nz\">\n<p id=\"791c\" class=\"ll lm oa ln b lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s like TripAdvisor but just for ice cream.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"8b66\" class=\"mj mk fr bf ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng bk\">Defining the scope of your MVP<\/h2>\n<p id=\"b1e1\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo nh lq lr ls ni lu lv lw nj ly lz ma nk mc md me nl mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Now that you\u2019ve done all the background research you need and decided on a value proposition, you can get started on defining the scope of your MVP: the list of features you have to include in the prototyping phase, to turn your value proposition into reality.<\/p>\n<p id=\"7c27\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Keep in mind that the value proposition you come up with shouldn\u2019t translate into many features.

These features are aspects of your product that have to be part of it from the very start. If even one of these is missing, the product has failed to deliver its value proposition.

These are aspects that should be included in your product if the time and resources allow for it to happen, as they would add a great deal to its working quality. However, if there\u2019s no feasible way to develop them in the MVP stage, they can be put on the backburner without doing significant harm. They\u2019re not critical to launch, but would be of great importance to the user.<\/p>\n<p id=\"9e54\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The ice cream finder app should include a way to save favourites and share them with friends.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li id=\"4938\" class=\"ll lm fr ln b lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi ob oc od bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"ln fs\">Nice-to-have features<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p id=\"3c4c\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Nice-to-have features represent a diverse range of features that, while adding to the general quality of the product, will not impair its overall functionality as an MVP.

These are tailored to product development and will ensure that you define the best version of your MVP. It provides seven criteria for assigning the appropriate priority to every feature of your product:<\/p>\n<p id=\"66aa\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"ln fs\">Business value:<\/strong> How much business value does a feature provide?

There are two ways of going about them: assigning them top priority to ensure they are implemented successfully or assigning them little priority to ensure that the minimal amount of resources were used in case of failure.<\/p>\n<p id=\"b7b5\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"ln fs\">Implementation difficulty:<\/strong> If a feature is particularly easy to implement, it could lead to a quick win.

However, if you do your research and approach the process with a clear objective in mind, it will end up being the unique product that sets you apart from the rest and acts as a stepping stone to big, brilliant things.<\/p>\n<p id=\"c95d\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Remember to identify your target audience and its pain points, consider your competitors carefully and prioritise according to what your users need, not what you\u2019d like.<\/p>\n<p id=\"f847\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ll lm fr ln b lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi fk bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In the end, all companies start with a product, but the truly great ones build a quality foundation and validate it first.
